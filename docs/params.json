  "body": "### Multilayer Film Calculator\r\n\r\nA little while ago (while avoiding my thesis), I wrote a small R package for the calculation of the optical response of multilayer thin films. It's called mlfilms.\r\n\r\nThis package uses the transfer matrix method outlined in [Pedrotti, Pedrotti and Pedrotti](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Optics-3rd-Frank-Pedrotti/dp/0131499335) to calculate the reflection, transmission and absorption of plane polarised light from an arbitary stack of thin films. It can accept complex optical constants, and can also include wavelength dependant (dispersive) materials. \r\n\r\n### To Install\r\n\r\nFrom within an R session, use the devtools package like so:\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\n\r\ninstall_github('tjconstant/mlfilms')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The Stack\r\n\r\nAll stacks are defined as a list of parameters, with the layers listed sequentially from top (incident side) to bottom (exit side). \r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmystack <- list(index=c(1,1.5,1,1.5+0.5i),thickness=c(100e-9,50e-9,20e-9,100e-9), repetitions=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nAs a quick example, here is how you'd calculate and plot the reflection from a thin silver film through a prism. This is a standard experiment in our lab which results in a reflectivity minima associated with a surface plasmon excitation.\r\n\r\nFirstly, load up the package.\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(mlfilms)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll also load up ggplot for plotting.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we simply construct a stack with an appropriate refractive index and thickness (45 nm), and calculate the reflection (the default covers an angle between 0 and 90 degrees), with incident medium set to glass.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlayers <- list(index = c(0.13+4i),thickness = c(45e-9),repetitions = 1)\r\n\r\nR_plasmon <- angle_scan(incident_medium.index = 1.5+0i,exit_medium.index = 1+0i,layers = layers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlotting the result using ggplot shows a critical edge related to the onset of total internal reflection in the prism, and the reflectivity minima resulting from a surface plasmon excitation on the silver/air interface.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nqplot(R_plasmon$angle*180/pi,R_plasmon$Reflection,geom=\"line\")+\r\n    theme_bw()+\r\n    scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0))+\r\n    xlab(\"angle (degrees)\")+\r\n    ylab(\"reflection\")\r\n```\r\n![plasmonplot](https://i.imgur.com/V4zXdjE.png)",
