Calculation of reflection from multilayer films using the transfer matrix method.

This package uses the transfer matrix method outlined in [Pedrotti, Pedrotti and Pedrotti](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Optics-3rd-Frank-Pedrotti/dp/0131499335) to calculate the reflection and transmission of plane polarised light from an arbitary stack of thin films.

## To Install

From within an R session, use the devtools package like so:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('tjconstant/mlfilms')
```

## The Layers


All layers are defined as a list of parameters, with the layers listed sequentially from top (incident side) to bottom (exit side). The list must contain the refractive indexes as `index` and the thicknesses of the layers as `thickness`. You may also optionally include a number of repetitions of the stack under `repetitions`.

For Example, for the following thin film stack shown in the diagram, with the listed thicknesses (t) and refractive indexes (n),

![example_figure](man/figures/example.png) 

The appropriate stack would be as follows,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mystack <- list(index = c(1.33, 1.75, 1.2, 1.3 + 1i),
                thickness = c(50e-9, 50e-9, 30e-9, 27e-9), 
                repetitions = 1)
```

Notice the incident and exit mediums are not part of the stack, and so their refracive indexes are not listed in the `mystack` list. They will be specificed when the optical response function is called (see below).  

## Example

As a quick example, here is how you'd calculate and plot the reflection from a thin silver film through a prism. This is a standard experiment in our lab which results in a reflectivity minima associated with a surface plasmon excitation.

We simply construct a stack with an appropriate refractive index and thickness (45 nm), and calculate the reflection (as a funciton of polar angle, setting the incident medium to glass.

```{r}
library(mlfilms)

mystack2 <- list(index = 0.13+4i, 
               thickness = 45e-9)

plasmon <- angle_scan(mystack2,
                      incident_medium.index = 1.5 + 0i)
```

Plotting the result using `ggplot` shows a critical edge related to the onset of total internal reflection in the prism, and the reflectivity minima resulting from a surface plasmon excitation on the silver/air interface.

```{r plasmon, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

plasmon %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = angle, y = Reflection))+
  geom_line() +
  xlab(expression(angle~(degree)))
```
